> Tetromino is a logic puzzle that originated in Japan. The puzzle consists of a rectangular or square grid with symbols in some of its cells. The symbols used are triangles, diamonds, squares, and circles.

**Some kinds:**

- "simple": just use shapes to fill a square/rectangle
- "shape": just use shapes to fill a square/rectangle that represents a shape (start, numbers, etc)
